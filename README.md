# i3-config
My personal configuration for i3

Dependencies
------------
If for some strange reason you want to use this config, you need the following:
* i3-gaps
* i3-msg (Comes with i3 by default, I think)
* i3status
* j4-dmenu-desktop
* xscreensaver
* Terminus (TTF) font
* feh

Most other stuff is optional, stuff will work fine without it.

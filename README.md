# i3-config
My personal configuration for the i3-gaps fork of the i3 window manager.
If you don't know it yet, check it out [here](https://i3wm.org/) and [here](https://github.com/Airblader/i3).

Dependencies
------------
If for some strange reason you want to use this config, you need the following:
* [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
* i3-msg (Comes with i3 by default, I think)
* [i3status](https://i3wm.org/i3status/)
* [j4-dmenu-desktop](https://github.com/enkore/j4-dmenu-desktop)
* [xscreensaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/)
* [Terminus (TTF) font](http://files.ax86.net/terminus-ttf/)
* [ttf-fontawesome](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-font-awesome/)
* [pango](http://www.pango.org/)
* [feh](http://feh.finalrewind.org/)

Most other stuff is optional, this will (most likely) work fine without it.
Chances are that you'll have to edit some paths in the i3 config in order to match your system though.
